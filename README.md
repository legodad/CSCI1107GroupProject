# CSCI1107GroupProject
A place for students of ARCC 1107 and Java classes to work on a group project

My initial thoughts on what we should try to have:
Simple database reads and writes
Gui possibly written with the Java tools we are working with


Initial Ideas:

Stephen: Traffic flow management software to maximize light cycles at intersections.
